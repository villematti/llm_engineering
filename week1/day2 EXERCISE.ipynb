      "   - Nämä muutokset saattavat vaikuttaa merivirtojen luonteeseen ja voimakkuuteen, mikä puolestaan voi vaikuttaa merenkulkuun sekä maaseutualueiden elinkeinoihin.\n",

      "4. **Yhteiskunnalliset Kysymykset ja Tulevaisuuden Suunnitelmat:**\n",

      "From the provided text, can you identify which neural network models or techniques are associated with preventing overfitting in machine learning?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:**  \n",
      "The text mentions a specific technique known as \"Dropout\" that is used to prevent neural networks from overfitting. This method was introduced by Nitish Srivastava and his colleagues: Geoffrey Hinton, Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Ruslan Salakhutdinov in their 2014 paper titled \"Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting\" published in the Journal of Machine Learning Research. Dropout works by randomly dropping units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training, which helps prevent over-reliance on particular neurons and thus reduces overfitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Context\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Dropout:** A regularization technique where during each iteration of training, a subset of neurons is ignored or \"dropped out.\" This prevents complex co-adaptations on training data as it forces the network to learn more robust features that are useful in conjunction with many different random subsets of the other neurons.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Regularization:** Techniques like Dropout fall under the broader category of regularization techniques, which are methods used to prevent overfitting by adding some form of constraint or penalty to the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "This technique is particularly effective for deep neural networks and has been widely adopted in various machine learning models.\n"
